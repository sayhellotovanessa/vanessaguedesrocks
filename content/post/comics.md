there are one million clark kents in stockholm. they take the train, drive their cars or ride their bikes in the streets every morning. while hiding their true self behind a large cape (which they say it is to protect them from the snow) they pay attention to their phone screens or listen to some music while look around. never in each otherâ€™s faces, eyes, or forehead. they fear to find some revealing emotion. every morning the duty calls when they get in the office. and they unzip their capes to show their uniforms, become supermen and save the payday.
