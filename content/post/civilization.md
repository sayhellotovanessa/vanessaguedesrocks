In the old times people threw heavy stones with catapults to invade new territories. Putting cities down. As we can do with heavy hearts, maybe, launch them across the ocean and strike other lands. I wish I could throw my heart away sometimes. We could even end up replacing old hearts there with our own. So our chests could receive new hearts, maybe from further countries, where electric energy is unstable. I would like to get a new one from a japanese woman who struggles to get rid of her alcoholism. I would give my heart to an american white man who always had everything. I donâ€™t know if he would be able to chose somebody else to receive his heart. the other is always a big mystery.
