      <description>there are one million clark kents in stockholm. they take the train, drive their cars or ride their bikes in the streets every morning. while hiding their true self behind a large cape (which they say it is to protect them from the snow) they pay attention to their phone screens or listen to some music while look around. never in each other’s faces, eyes, or forehead. they fear to find some revealing emotion.</description>

      <description>there is a light that never goes out after 3pm. in Sweden, during the winter. it goes in a spiritual retreat after the first cool wind blow and it drives people crazy when they see the light for a couple of minutes once a week — that moment when everybody looks like plants doing photosynthesis in their heavy dark coats. they try to reach the light to get some wisdom: dear light, tell us how to live humbly and be fulfilled in life.</description>

      <description>In the old times people threw heavy stones with catapults to invade new territories. Putting cities down. As we can do with heavy hearts, maybe, launch them across the ocean and strike other lands. I wish I could throw my heart away sometimes. We could even end up replacing old hearts there with our own. So our chests could receive new hearts, maybe from further countries, where electric energy is unstable.</description>
